# Crisis_Reddit_Bot
A bot intended to redirect Reddit users experiencing suicidal ideation to appropriate resources. Made with the PRAW API and a little bit of ❤.

## How it works:
Uses the PRAW API (Python Reddit API Wrapper - See: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to scrape through new posts on Reddit scanning for keywords that indicate suicidal ideation. The bot responds by redirecting the user to appropriate resources.
