# Crisis_Reddit_Bot
A bot intended to redirect Reddit users experiencing suicidal ideation to appropriate resources. Made with the PRAW API and a little bit of ‚ù§.

## How it works:
Uses the PRAW API (Python Reddit API Wrapper - see: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to scrape through new posts on Reddit scanning for keywords that indicate suicidal ideation. The bot responds by redirecting the user to appropriate resources.

## Why I built it:
Pandemics aside, life has become increasingly more stressful in recent years. As mental health is still something that is unfortunately stigmatized, many individuals look to anonymous online forums for support. This creates a new avenue for reaching vulnerable individuals. 

## How to get it running: 
1. pip install praw on your machine
2. Replace the PRAW instantiation on line 51 with your information (see the docs linked above).
3. Hit run
4. ???
5. Profit!
